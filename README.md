# 1 Project Description
## 1.1 Primary Goal
In this project we build machine learning models for categorizing images. We will write programs that takes images of hand-written numbers and output what numbers the images represent. The three machine learning algorithms to be used are:
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

## 1.2 Dataset
MNIST is a dataset composed of handwritten numbers and their labels. It is a famous dataset that has been used for testing new machine-learning algorithm's performance. Each MNIST image is a 28x28 grey-scale image. Data is provided as 28x28 matrices containing numbers ranging from 0 (corresponding to white pixels) to 255 (corresponding to black pixels). Labels for each image are also provided with integer values ranging from 0 to 9, corresponding to the actual value in the image. There are 6500 images in our version of the database and 6500 corresponding labels.

## Tasks
In this project we will experiment with training machine learning models for identifying which number is represented by a MNIST image. The input of the model will be an image, and the output will be a classification of the number, from 0 to 9.
